Hello, I’m 0x03c6.

My interests include programming, compiler theory, theoretical computer science, vulnerability research and playing CTFs.

Feel free to look around, this site is primarily a place to store and archive challenge writeups, explanations, notes on topics I’m currently researching, or just rants.
